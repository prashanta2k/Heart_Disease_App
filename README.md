📌 Project Overview
This project uses a trained Machine Learning model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on clinical features such as:

Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Cholesterol
Fasting Blood Sugar
Maximum Heart Rate
Exercise Induced Angina
And more...
The model is deployed using Streamlit for interactive user input and real-time prediction.
